    <h1>Jalbei</h1>
    <img src="../Images/Jalebi.JPG" alt="">
    <p>Jalebi is a vibrant orange,

        pretzel-shaped sweet from India. Made from a fermented batter that's fried and soaked in sugar syrup, it boasts
        a crispy exterior and a soft, juicy interior. The sugary syrup imbues jalebi with a sweet and slightly tangy
        flavor, making it a popular dessert during festivals and celebrations.
